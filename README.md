# 4.4 GitHub Recreation

This project we were tasked with using Asynchronous JavaScript and AJAX calls and promises. I used GitHub's API and made a recreation of my GitHub Repo page.


### Tech Used

During the development of this project I used the following technology:


* [HTML5] - latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages
* [CSS3] - latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - fast and concise Javascript Library
